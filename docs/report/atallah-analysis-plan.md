# Planned revisions to reproduction of Malcomb et al. (2014)
The paper whose analysis I aim to revise is the following:

Malcomb, D. W., E. A. Weaver, and A. R. Krakowka. 2014. Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi. *Applied Geography* 48:17â€“30. DOI:[10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.01.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.01.004).

## Analysis
1. I will revise the final comparison map to create a more readable color scheme.
2. I will add to the discussion section, which is currently empty, to analyze the two comparison figures produced by the reproduction.
3. I will add to the conclusion section, which is currently empty, to posit whether the reproduction could be considered a success.

## Results

1. The revised map will be shown in the same section as in the original paper (the last piece of the results)
2. The discussion section will appear under the heading. It will incorporate some terms from the framework of Tate (2013).
3. The conclusion section will appear after the discussion section.

## Discussion

1. If the revised map has an improved color scheme, it may improve the ability of readers to understand the map and discern areas where there are fainter colors.
2. If the discussion section is added to, it may allow for an exploration of what the comparison figures could tell us about the differences between the reproduction study and the original study. 
3. If the conclusion section is added to, it may allow readers to engage with the idea of whether the reproduction was a success. This was the aim of the conclusion section in the prior report.
